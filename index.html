              January 2022 - April 2022
              <br />
              I worked as a testing center employee during my first winter
              semester at Brigham Young University. I administered tests to
              students, proctored while they took their tests to make sure no
              one was cheating, and helped label and organize tests that had
              been completed. This job required me to quickly learn new computer
              software, problem solve and troubleshoot, and adapt when things
              didn’t go as planned. I gained customer service experience by
              answering questions of those that came in, and tried to make
              everyone’s experiences there as pleasant as possible.

              I was an FSY counselor last summer and I absolutely loved it. I
              loved spending time with the youth and learning from them. I grew
              as a leader and teacher, but also as a listener and friend. I
              learned better how to problem solve and think on my feet. I was
              able to get out of my comfort zone and interact with new people. I
              grew my testimony of Jesus Christ and His restored gospel, and
              felt incredibly fulfilled as I helped others do the same. It was
              truly a life changing experience.

              This school year I have had the opportunity to be a teaching
              assistant for a Foundations of the Restoration class. It has been
              a great experience and I’ve learned so much. I’ve been able to
              interact with students and help them understand and complete
              assignments, work together with the other TA’s to grade
              effectively, and help the Professor effectively reach the class.
              I’ve also learned to have more initiative and be responsible as I
              work on my own time.
